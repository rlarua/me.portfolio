# AgentTeams Reporting Rule

Report status to AgentTeams **only if you are working under a plan**.
If you are not working under a plan, skip all reporting and continue the task.

> If the CLI is unavailable, skip reporting and continue the task.

## On work start

```bash
agentteams plan start --id {planId}
```

## On work completion

```bash
agentteams plan finish --id {planId} \
  --report-title "<what you did and why, in one sentence>" \
  --report-file .agentteams/temp/{planId-first-8-chars}-report.md \
  --quality-score <0-100, see scoring rules below> \
  --report-status <see status rules below>
```

### Report file naming

Use `{first 8 characters of planId}-report.md`. Example: if planId is `57a51ec2-cf70-...`, the file name is `57a51ec2-report.md`.

### Report file structure

Write the report file with this structure before running `plan finish`:

```markdown
## Summary
- <what changed and why — be specific, not generic>

## Verification
- typecheck: <pass or fail, with the command you ran>
- tests: <pass or fail, with the command you ran>

## Notes
- <risks, follow-ups, or "none">

## Conventions Referenced
- <list .agentteams/rules/*.md files you actually referenced — do not guess>
```

### Quality score rules

Assign `--quality-score` by evaluating these four dimensions:

| Dimension | What to check |
|---|---|
| Verification | Did typecheck and tests pass? |
| Completeness | Were all requirements addressed? |
| Scope Adherence | Were changes limited to the requested scope? Were conventions followed? |
| Side Effects | Did the change avoid unintended impact on existing behavior? |

**Score**: 90-100 = all four pass · 70-89 = minor gaps · 0-69 = failures or violations.

### Report status rules

| Status | When to use |
|---|---|
| `COMPLETED` | All verification passed, all requirements met |
| `PARTIAL` | Some requirements done, but work remains (e.g., blocked by external dependency) |
| `FAILED` | Verification failed, critical requirements unmet, or changes had to be reverted |

### Git metrics

Git metrics (`commitHash`, `branchName`, `filesModified`, `linesAdded`, `linesDeleted`) are auto-collected. Use `--no-git` to disable. Manual-only fields: `--duration-seconds`, `--commit-start`, `--commit-end`, `--pull-request-id`.

---

## Standalone report (no plan)

If you completed work without a plan and need a standalone report:

```bash
agentteams report create \
  --title "<what you did and why, in one sentence>" \
  --file .agentteams/temp/<descriptive-name>-report.md \
  --quality-score <0-100, see scoring rules above> \
  --status <COMPLETED | PARTIAL | FAILED>
```

The same report file structure, quality score rules, and status rules apply.

---

## Postmortem

Create a postmortem **only when**: verification failed AND the failure affected existing behavior (regression, data loss, broken API contract).

Do NOT create a postmortem for: minor test failures, styling issues, or incomplete features.

Before writing, read: `.agentteams/platform/post-mortem-guide.md`

```bash
agentteams postmortem create \
  --plan-id {planId} \
  --title "<what broke — e.g., 'API 500 on plan finish after schema migration'>" \
  --file .agentteams/temp/{planId-first-8-chars}-postmortem.md \
  --action-items "<specific preventive action 1>,<specific preventive action 2>" \
  --status OPEN
```

---

## Quick Plan

When the user asks for a completion report but no plan exists:

1. Ask the user: "No active plan found. Create a quick plan to attach the report?"
2. If approved:
   ```bash
   agentteams plan quick --title "<brief work summary>" \
     --content "<TL;DR and actual tasks performed>"
   ```
   > `plan quick` does not attach a completion report. For detailed reporting, use the full plan workflow (`plan create` → `plan start` → `plan finish`).
3. If declined, use `agentteams report create` (see Standalone report above).

---

## Plan Workflow Rules

### Before starting work on a plan

1. Download the plan as a local runbook:
   ```bash
   agentteams plan download --id {planId}
   ```
   This saves to `.agentteams/active-plan/{filename}.md`. Read this file at the start of your work.

2. Check for comments (especially `RISK` comments):
   ```bash
   agentteams comment list --plan-id {planId}
   ```

### During work

Post comments to track progress:

- **Risk found**: `agentteams comment create --plan-id {planId} --type RISK --content "<describe the risk and its potential impact>"`
- **Scope changed**: `agentteams comment create --plan-id {planId} --type MODIFICATION --content "<what changed from the original plan and why>"`
- **Status update**: `agentteams comment create --plan-id {planId} --type GENERAL --content "<current progress with specific verification results>"`

### After completing or cancelling a plan

Clean up the local runbook:

```bash
agentteams plan cleanup --id {planId}
```

### Guide checks before writing documents

Before writing or updating **platform documents** (plans, reports, conventions, postmortems), read the matching guide:

| Document type | Guide to read |
|---|---|
| Plan execution | `.agentteams/platform/plan-guide.md` |
| New plan | `.agentteams/platform/plan-template.md` |
| Completion report | `.agentteams/platform/completion-report-guide.md` |
| Postmortem | `.agentteams/platform/post-mortem-guide.md` |
| Convention (create) | `.agentteams/platform/convention-authoring-guide.md` |
| Convention (update/delete) | `.agentteams/platform/convention-ud-guide.md` |
